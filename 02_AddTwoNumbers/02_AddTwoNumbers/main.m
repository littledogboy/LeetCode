/* 2. Add Two Numbers
 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 
 You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 
 Example:
 
 Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
 Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
 Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
